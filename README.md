# Weather Data Analyzer

This project is a simple app that reads weather data and shows basic information using modern Java (from Java 15 to Java 23). It uses new features like records, enhanced switch statements, text blocks, lambdas, and streams.

## What It Does

- **Read CSV Data:** Loads weather data from the `weatherdata.csv` file.
- **Average Temperature:** Computes the average temperature for a chosen month.
- **Hot Days List:** Shows days when the temperature is above a set value.
- **Rainy Days Count:** Counts the number of days with rain.
- **Weather Categories:** Classifies days as "Hot", "Warm", or "Cold" using an enhanced switch.

## Project Files

- **WeatherDataAnalyzer.java:** Contains all the code for reading data and performing calculations.
- **weatherdata.csv:** A sample file with weather data (Date, Temperature, Humidity, Precipitation).
- **README.md:** This file, which explains what the project does and how to use it.
